# React.js and Next.js Mastering Course

## Session 12

### 1. Add a Skeleton for Movies List

When loading the movies list, users might experience a delay before the data is fetched and displayed. To improve the user experience during this loading phase, you can implement a skeleton loader. A skeleton loader is a placeholder UI that mimics the structure of the content being loaded, giving users a visual cue that data is on its way.

- **How to Implement**: Use Tailwind CSS to create skeleton components or leverage a library like `shadcn/ui - Skeleton` for pre-built skeleton loaders. These components can be styled to match the layout of your movie cards.

### 2. Handle Invalid Image URLs

Sometimes, the image URLs for movies might be invalid or broken, leading to a poor user experience with missing or broken images. To address this, you can implement error handling for image loading.

- **How to Implement**: Use the `onError` event of the `<img>` tag to detect when an image fails to load. Replace the broken image with a fallback image or placeholder. This ensures the UI remains visually consistent even when the original image is unavailable.

### 3. Breakdown Dashboard Layout

The dashboard layout can be complex, with multiple sections like navigation, content, and sidebars. Breaking it down into smaller, reusable components makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

- **How to Implement**: Identify the key sections of the dashboard (e.g., header, sidebar, main content). Create separate components for each section and compose them together in the main dashboard layout.

### 4. Implement Dashboard Layout

Once the layout is broken down into components, you can implement the full dashboard layout by combining these components. This step involves ensuring proper styling, responsiveness, and functionality.

- **How to Implement**: Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or custom styles to arrange the components. Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application.

### 5. [Metadata Object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object)

Metadata provides additional information about your application, such as the page title, description, and SEO-related tags. Properly managing metadata improves the discoverability and usability of your application.

- **How to Implement**: Use the built-in metadata management features of Next.js, such as the `<Head>` component or the `metadata` configuration in the `app` directory. Dynamically set metadata for each page to ensure it is relevant and descriptive.

### 6. [Caching in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching)

Caching in Next.js can significantly enhance the performance of your application by reducing redundant data fetching and improving load times. Next.js provides several built-in mechanisms and integrations to handle caching effectively.

- **How to Implement**:
  - **Static Generation (SSG)**: Use `getStaticProps` to fetch data at build time. The generated static pages are cached and served directly from the CDN, ensuring fast load times.
  - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Update static pages at runtime by specifying a `revalidate` interval in `getStaticProps`. This allows you to serve cached pages while keeping the data fresh.
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Caching**: Use caching headers like `Cache-Control` in API routes or server responses to control how long the data should be cached by the browser or CDN.
  - **Client-Side Caching**: Leverage libraries like `react-query` or `SWR` for caching API responses on the client side. These libraries provide features like automatic revalidation and stale-while-revalidate for efficient data fetching.
  - **Image Optimization Caching**: Use the Next.js `<Image>` component, which automatically caches optimized images for better performance.

By combining these caching strategies, you can ensure a seamless and efficient user experience while maintaining up-to-date data.

## Practical Assessment

### Task: Create and Run a Next.js Project

1. **Setup Development Environment**

   - Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
   - Use Create Next App to initialize a new Next.js project.

2. **Project Structure Exploration**

   - Open the newly created project in your code editor.
   - Identify and describe the purpose of the following files:
     - `package.json`
     - `package-lock.json`

3. **JSX Implementation** (Optional)

   - Create a new component using JSX.
   - Integrate the component into the main page of your Next.js project.

4. **Node.js and npm Usage**

   - Explain the role of Node.js in your project.
   - List and describe at least three npm commands you used during the setup and development process.

5. **Dependencies Management**

   - Identify the dependencies and devDependencies in your `package.json`.
   - Explain the difference between dependencies and devDependencies.
   - Research and provide a brief history of React.js and Next.js, including key contributors and milestones.
   - Install a third-party library that will be useful. (Ex: `ky`, `clsx`, `framer-motion`)

6. **Running the Project**
   - Start the development server using the appropriate npm command.
   - Access your project in the browser and verify it runs correctly.
   - Document any issues you encountered and how you resolved them.

### Submission

- Submit your project files along with a `ANSWERS.md` under `session-05` folder that includes your explanations and findings.
- Ensure your project runs without errors before submission.
- Provide screenshots of your running application and any relevant code snippets.

Good luck!

# React.js and Next.js Mastering Course (Batch 04)

## Session 13

### 1. Breakdown Dashboard Layout ✅

The dashboard layout can be complex, with multiple sections like navigation, content, and sidebars. Breaking it down into smaller, reusable components makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

- **How to Implement**: Identify the key sections of the dashboard (e.g., header, sidebar, main content). Create separate components for each section and compose them together in the main dashboard layout.

### 2. Implement Dashboard Layout ✅

Once the layout is broken down into components, you can implement the full dashboard layout by combining these components. This step involves ensuring proper styling, responsiveness, and functionality.

- **How to Implement**: Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or custom styles to arrange the components. Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application.

### 3. Build User Drop Down ❌

- User avatar
- User related links
- Logout (Sign Out)

### 4. Build the Admin Movies Page UI ❌

- Integrate and utilize the `dialog` component from `shadcn/ui` for modal functionality.
- Incorporate the `select` component from `shadcn/ui` for dropdown menus.
- Use the `textarea` component from `shadcn/ui` for multi-line text inputs.

### 5. REST API and Database Integration (Phase I) ❌

- **Admin Movies Page and Movie Creation Form:**

  - Developed the `admin/movies` page along with a `Create Movie` form.
  - The form enables administrators to input movie details, including the title, description, and release date.

- **Server-Side Action for Movie Creation:**

  - Implemented a server-side action to handle form submissions.
  - This action validates the input data and processes the movie creation request.

- **Persisting Data in MongoDB:**

  - Established a connection to a MongoDB database for data storage.
  - Movie details submitted through the form are stored in the `movies` collection.
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation mechanisms are in place to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

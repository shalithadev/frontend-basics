### 1. Add a Skeleton for Movies List ✅

When loading the movies list, users might experience a delay before the data is fetched and displayed. To improve the user experience during this loading phase, you can implement a skeleton loader. A skeleton loader is a placeholder UI that mimics the structure of the content being loaded, giving users a visual cue that data is on its way.

- **How to Implement**: Use Tailwind CSS to create skeleton components or leverage a library like `shadcn/ui - Skeleton` for pre-built skeleton loaders. These components can be styled to match the layout of your movie cards.

### 2. Handle Invalid Image URLs ✅

Sometimes, the image URLs for movies might be invalid or broken, leading to a poor user experience with missing or broken images. To address this, you can implement error handling for image loading.

- **How to Implement**: Use the `onError` event of the `<img>` tag to detect when an image fails to load. Replace the broken image with a fallback image or placeholder. This ensures the UI remains visually consistent even when the original image is unavailable.

### 3. Breakdown Dashboard Layout ❌

The dashboard layout can be complex, with multiple sections like navigation, content, and sidebars. Breaking it down into smaller, reusable components makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

- **How to Implement**: Identify the key sections of the dashboard (e.g., header, sidebar, main content). Create separate components for each section and compose them together in the main dashboard layout.

### 4. Implement Dashboard Layout ❌

Once the layout is broken down into components, you can implement the full dashboard layout by combining these components. This step involves ensuring proper styling, responsiveness, and functionality.

- **How to Implement**: Use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or custom styles to arrange the components. Ensure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application.
